## Code Convention

- Follow the [JavaScript Style Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).

- Ensure your code adheres to the existing style and formatting.

## Basic Rules

1. **Branch Naming:**
   - Use a descriptive and lowercase branch name.
   - If you're working on a feature, prefix the branch with `feature/`.
   - If it's a bug fix, use `bugfix/`.
   - Example: `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-bug`.

2. **Commit Messages:**
   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Start with a capitalized verb and use the present tense.
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
   - Add detailed explanations when necessary.

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add new feature"

     # or

     git commit -m "Fix issue with login service"
     ```

3. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Create a new branch for your PR.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes.
   - Reference any relevant issues or PRs.
   - Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR.
   - Ensure existing tests pass, and add new tests if needed.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Update the README or relevant documentation for any user-facing changes.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to test and use new features.
