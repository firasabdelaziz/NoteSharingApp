## Technical Patterns

### Provider Design Pattern

Authentication is managed using the Provider design pattern with the `AuthContext` in `AuthContext.js`.

### Factory Design Pattern

Validation is handled using the Factory design pattern in `validationFactory.js`.

### Hooks

Several custom hooks are used, including `useFirestore`, `useKeyboardHandling`, and `usePasswordToggle` for enhanced functionality.

## Authentication

The app uses Firebase Authentication for user registration and login. It supports both email/password and Gmail login.

### Auth Context

The authentication context is managed using React's `useReducer` hook and provides actions for signing in and signing out.

### State Management

The app utilizes the `useAuth` hook for managing the authentication state. It includes a reducer for handling authentication actions and an auth context for sharing authentication details throughout the app.

## Services

### Signup Service

The `signupService` provides the functionality to register a new user using Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`.

### Signout Service

The `signoutService` handles user sign-out using Firebase's `signOut` method. It also includes the capability to sign out with Google.

### Sign-in with Google

The `signInWithGoogle` service allows users to sign in using their Google accounts. It utilizes the `react-native-google-signin` library for integration.

### Login Service

The `loginService` provides the functionality to log in a user using Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword`.

## Hooks

### Password Toggle Hook

The `usePasswordToggle` hook manages the visibility of the password input in login and registration screens.

### Keyboard Handling Hook

The `useKeyboardHandling` hook tracks the keyboard status, allowing components to respond to its visibility changes.

## Firebase Configuration

Firebase is configured in the `config.js` file, including initialization of Firestore and Authentication modules.

## Firestore Integration

The `useFirestore` hook is responsible for listening to changes in the Firestore database, specifically in the "PockerPlanning" collection.

## Screens

### Welcome Screen

The `WelcomeScreen` component serves as the initial screen for users to either log in or create a new account.

### Registration Screen

The `RegistrationScreen` component handles user registration, including email and password validation. It integrates with the `signupService` for user registration.

### Login Screen

The `LoginScreen` component facilitates user login, featuring email and password validation. It utilizes the `loginService` for user login and `signInWithGoogle` for Google authentication.

### Home Screen

The `HomeScreen` component displays collaborative notes among users. It integrates with Firebase Firestore for real-time updates of player notes. Users can update their notes and sign out.
